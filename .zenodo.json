  "title": "pytoon-codec: TOON encoder/decoder for time series and events",
  "description": "A compact Python encoder/decoder for TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation), tuned for time-series and nested event logs in LLM prompts. It supports tabular TOON blocks for arrays of objects, dotted-path flattening for nested structures, and type-preserving round-trip conversion between JSON and TOON format. Designed to maximize token efficiency while maintaining human readability.",
